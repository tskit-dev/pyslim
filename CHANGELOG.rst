***************************
[UPCOMING.X.X] - XXXX-XX-XX
***************************

**Notable changes**:

- Switched to using tskit native encoding/decoding of metadata via schemas.
- added to conda-forge (@winni2k)

**New features**:

- enabled dumping the reference sequence for nucleotide models
- added has_individual_parents, a method to find individuals with all parents
  are also recorded as individuals
- Provenance handling:
   * added the `.slim_provenances` property to return all SLiM provenance entries
   * added the `slim_provenance_version` and `parse_provenance` methods to tell if
      provenance entries come from SLiM and to parse them
- documentation for recapitation with a nonuniform map by :user:@TeresaPegan

**Bug fixes**:

- fixed differential time offset for tree sequences saved out in early versus late:
   prior to this, mutation_at and nucleotides_at would have been sometimes wrong if the tree sequence
   was saved out during late

********************
[0.401] - 2020-03-27
********************

**Bug fixes**:

- checks for the ability to simulate with a discrete recombination map
   in the available version of msprime, and sets the default flat
   recombination map in recapitate appropriately

********************
[0.400] - 2020-03-24
********************

**New features**:

- updated to take and output SLiM file version 0.4, which only differs from 0.3
   in minor aspects of provenance

********************
[0.314] - 2019-10-31
********************

**New features**:

- allows passing in of a recombination map to recapitate (:user:`mufernando`)
- added first_generation_individuals() function
- defined individual ages for WF ages
- added mutation_at() and fixed up nucleotide_at() functions
