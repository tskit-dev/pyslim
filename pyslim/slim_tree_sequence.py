        Returns a "recapitated" tree sequence, by using msprime to run a
        coalescent simulation from the "top" of this tree sequence, i.e.,
        allowing any uncoalesced lineages to coalesce.

        To allow recapitation to be done correctly, the nodes of the
        first generation of the SLiM simulation from whom all samples inherit
        are still present in the tree sequence, but are not marked as samples.
        If you simplify the tree sequence before recapitating you must ensure
        these are not removed, which you do by passing the argument
        ``keep_input_roots=True`` to :meth:`.simplify()`.

        Note that ``Ne`` is not set automatically, so defaults to ``1.0``; you probably
        want to set it explicitly.  Similarly, migration is not set up
        automatically, so that if there are uncoalesced lineages in more than
        one population, you will need to pass in a migration matrix to allow
        coalescence. In both cases, remember that population IDs in ``tskit`` begin
        with 0, so that if your SLiM simulation has populations ``p1`` and ``p2``,
        then the tree sequence will have three populations (but with no nodes
        assigned to population 0), so that migration rate of 1.0 between ``p1`` and
        ``p2`` needs a migration matrix of::

           [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]]

        In general, all defaults are whatever the defaults of ``msprime.simulate`` are;
        this includes recombination rate, so that if neither ``recombination_rate``
        or a ``recombination_map`` are provided, there will be *no* recombination.

        However, if ``recombination_rate`` *is* provided, then recapitation will
        use a constant rate of recombination on a discretized map -- in other words,
        recombinations in the coalescent portion of the simulation will only occur
        at integer locations, just as in SLiM. If you do not want this to happen,
        you need to construct a ``recombination_map`` explicitly.

        :param float recombination_rate: A (constant) recombination rate,
            in units of crossovers per nucleotide per unit of time.
        :param list population_configurations: See :meth:`msprime.simulate` for
            this argument; if not provided, each population will have zero growth rate
            and the same effective population size.

        """
        Returns an array giving the IDs of all individuals that are known to be
        alive at the given time ago.  This is determined using their birth time
        ago (given by their `time` attribute) and, for nonWF models,
        their `age` attribute (which is equal to their age at the last time
        they were Remembered). See also :meth:`.individual_ages_at`.

        In WF models, birth occurs after "early()", so that individuals are only
        alive during "late()" for the time step when they have age zero,
        while in nonWF models, birth occurs before "early()", so they are alive
        for both stages.
        
        In both WF and nonWF models, mortality occurs between
        "early()" and "late()", so that individuals are last alive during the
        "early()" stage of the time step of their final age, and if individuals
        are alive during "late()" they will also be alive during "early()" of the
        next time step. This means it is important to know during which stage
        individuals were Remembered - for instance, if the call to
        sim.treeSeqRememberIndividuals() was made during "early()" of a given time step,
        then those individuals might not have survived until "late()" of that
        time step. Since SLiM does not record the stage at which individuals
        were Remembered, you can specify this by setting ``remembered_stages``:
        it should be the stage during which *all* calls to sim.treeSeqRememberIndividuals,
        as well as to sim.treeSeqOutput(), were made.

        Note also that in nonWF models, birth occurs before "early()", so the
        possible parents in a given time step are those that are alive in
        "early()" and have age greater than zero, or, equivalently, are alive in
        "late()" during the previous time step.
        In WF models, birth occurs after "early()", so possible parents in a

    tables.  This will replace any existing Individual table, and will replace
    any information already in the individual, metadata, and population columns
    of the Node table.

    This is designed to make it easy to assign default values:
    - (node_ind) the 2*j-th and (2*j+1)-st `sample` nodes to individual j
    - (location) individual locations to (0, 0, 0)
    - (age) individual age to 0
    - (ind_id) SLiM individual pedigree IDs to sequential integers starting from 0
    - (ind_population) individual populations to 0
    - (node_id) SLiM genome IDs to sequential integers starting with samples from 0
    - (node_is_null) genomes to be non-null
    - (node_type) genome type to 0 (= autosome)
    - (ind_flags) INDIVIDUAL_ALIVE

    If you have other situations, like non-alive "remembered" individuals, you
    will need to edit the tables by hand, afterwards.
